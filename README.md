AkaShop is my first full-stack project that allows for CRUD operations on products. I built it using .NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. The project incorporates JWT for registration/login, pagination, React Router for navigation, and Context API for prop drilling.

## Features

- **CRUD Functionality**: Add, edit, and view products.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based registration and login system.
- **Pagination**: Implemented on both frontend and backend for efficient data handling.
- **Technologies Used**: .NET Core, React, PostgreSQL.
- **Styling**: I used raw CSS for styling, without any external libraries or frameworks.
- **Tooling**: Vite for React development.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon Tech website.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Database**: Set up a PostgreSQL database. I used Neon Tech, but you can use any PostgreSQL host.
2. **Backend Configuration**: Configure the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file of the .NET Core backend.
3. **Frontend Configuration**: Make sure the frontend's API endpoints point to your backend's URL or IP address.

## My Learning Journey

- React is a new framework for me. This project has been an exciting journey into frontend development with JavaScript.
- While I could have added more complex features, my main goal was to learn and demonstrate my growing skills in .NET Core and React.
- I've used several other technologies and practices that I haven't mentioned here. Feel free to explore the codebase to see how I've structured things and what other tools or libraries I might have incorporated.

I'm proud of what I've built and learned along the way. Feel free to dive into AkaShop's code, run it yourself, and let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions!
